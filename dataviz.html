          <div class="title">> background</div>
            <p>My interest in data visualization rose from my work in social justice and gaming. When researching the role of online interactivity influencing offline action, I discovered <a href=”http://explorableexplanations.com>Explorable Explanations</a>, a digital movement focused on active learning. Explorable Explanations are interactive blog posts or visualizations that teach a concept by doing. Much of the work of a social activist is advocacy; simultaneously raising awareness and communicating the urgency of the issue. This involves designing for communication, interpreting highly technical datasets in a digestible way, and clearly displaying insights gleaned from the data. Visualizations blend my interests in information and play, and challenge both my design and development skills.</p>

            <p>Below are samples of works I have completed or am currently pursuing. I'm always open to project ideas, so if you want to talk please shoot me a message!</p>

          <div class="title">> visualizing USA data</div>
          <p>This is the second project for a data visualization course I took during spring 2016. It is a collection of univariate and bivariate color maps of various USA data, coded in d3.js. The hexagon representation of the country is an open-source contribution from the NPR Graphics team. My partner and I built functions to convert that data into a color spectrum. The project was an exercise in interpreting numerical data into accurate, readable graphs using changing color value. The project is hosted live on <a href="https://jmithani.github.io/usa-hexagons/">Github</a>.

          <div class="title">> sexual assault in game of thrones</div>
          <p>While browsing online one day, I found an <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/someone-has-done-a-statistical-analysis-of-rape-in-game-1707037159">article</a> about someone who had counted and compared all acts of rape in the popular TV series &quot;Games of Thrones&quot; with its print counterpart, the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> series. (See the Tumblr post <a href="http://tafkarfanfic.tumblr.com/post/119770640640/rape-in-asoiaf-vs-game-of-thrones-a-statistical">here</a>.) One thing I noticed right away from the descriptions is that often, the person assaulted was an unnamed woman, and the assaulter was a heavy-hitting bad guy.</p>
          <p>This reminded me of readings on how violence against women is used as a backdrop to further male character development - in this case, to showcase how evil a character really is. From the article, many of the women who were assaulted were minor characters, with a rape occasionally being their only participation in the entire series.</p>

          <p>In order to bring more attention to this, I wanted to create a more complete data set archiving not just sexual assault in “Game of Thrones,” but all sex scenes in the series in order to make comparisons between on-screen sex, significant male characters, and discarded female characters. Right now I am putting together a .csv data set using episode descriptions from the <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki">Game of Throne Wikia</a>. Once that is complete, I plan to visualize the data a) using network analysis to show which male characters commit the most assaults and whether they are represented as an antagonist in the series; b) interactivity in the network analysis to highlight unnamed female characters; and c) through bar charts to compare statistics on consensual and non-consensual sex scenes.</p>

          <p>The image above is from a quick network analysis I wrote in R, which consists of the data provided in the analysis linked above. The primitive, undirected graph simply indicates that there are clusters of assaults all committed by a single, named male character. I look forward to fleshing out my ideas for visualizations in d3.js, especially including the new metadata I am adding from the data set I am building. </p>
