            <p>My interest in data visualization rose from my work in social justice and gaming. When researching the role of online interactivity influencing offline action, I discovered <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com">Explorable Explanations</a>, a digital movement focused on active learning. Explorable Explanations are interactive blog posts or visualizations that teach a concept by doing.</p> 
            <p>Much of the work of a social activist is advocacy; simultaneously raising awareness and communicating the urgency of the issue. This involves designing for communication, interpreting highly technical datasets in a digestible way, and clearly displaying insights gleaned from the data. Visualizations blend my interests in information and play, and challenge both my design and development skills.</p>

            <p>Below are samples of works I have completed or am currently pursuing. These are a mix of practical work in d3 and original research. I'm always open to project ideas, so if you want to talk please shoot me a message!</p>


          <div class="title heading">USA data maps</div>

          <div class="picture">

          <p><br \>This is the second project for a data visualization course I took during spring 2016. It is a collection of univariate and bivariate color maps of various USA data, coded in d3.js. The hexagon representation of the country is an open-source contribution from the NPR Graphics team. My partner and I built functions to convert that data into a color spectrum. The project was an exercise in interpreting numerical data into accurate, readable graphs using changing color value. The project is hosted live on <a href="https://jmithani.github.io/usa-hexagons/">Github</a>.</p>

          <div class="title heading">mapping title ix cases</div>
          <p>As I built out my data visualization skillset, I wanted to learn how to create maps. I wanted to visualize meaningful data, and chose to utilize the data from the Chronicle of Higher Education’s <a href="http://projects.chronicle.com/titleix/">Title IX Tracker</a> API.</p>

          <p>Right now, I’ve imported the data into a CSV file, merged it with IPEDS data to determine coordinates of each school with R, and mapped it geographically with d3 projections. I plan to add interactivity by allowing users to toggle state data (including population, education level, and income) as well as school data (money spent on sports, Title IX violations, US News Top Colleges).</p>

          <div class="picture">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/titleix.PNG"></img>
            <p class="description">Geographic distribution of Title IX cases.</p>
          </div>

          <p>I chose to use this data to familiarize myself with the state of Title IX investigations today in preparation for a project at a later date. It’s no secret that UChicago, my school, has been convicted of gross Title IX violations. In a step to remedy this, a campus climate survey conducted in 2015 collected data on sexual misconduct amongst members of the UChicago community. In the future, I’d like to make easily-understood visualizations of this data, and compare it that gathered from other colleges.</p>

          <p>Working on this map visualization has introduced me to the world of Geographic Information Systems and cartography, subjects I previously knew nothing about. It’s spurred an ongoing research interest in how space and place are visualized, and the politics that can bias maps.</p>

          <p>An interesting problem I am working to design around is the clustering of schools on the east coast. I showed my map to a friend, who was horrified by the apparent plague of sexual assault in New England. I explained that there isn’t an epidemic (or there might be, but we need more information) but rather a larger number of colleges and higher population density on the east coast. I’m going to experiment with eliminating this conclusion by highlighting state population data, or college density by state.</p>

            <p class="description">Beginning of the tumblr post that inspired this project.</p>
          </div>
          <p>While browsing online one day, I found an <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/someone-has-done-a-statistical-analysis-of-rape-in-game-1707037159">article</a> about someone who had counted and compared all acts of rape in the popular TV series &quot;Games of Thrones&quot; (GOT) with its print counterpart, the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> (ASOIAF) series. (See the Tumblr post <a href="http://tafkarfanfic.tumblr.com/post/119770640640/rape-in-asoiaf-vs-game-of-thrones-a-statistical">here</a>.) One thing I noticed right away from the descriptions is that often, the person assaulted was an unnamed woman, and the assaulter was a heavy-hitting bad guy.</p>

          <div class="picture">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/csv.PNG"></img>
            <p class="description">CSV file I made from tafkar's data on rape in ASAOIF.</p>
          </div>

          <p>This reminded me of readings on how violence against women is used as a backdrop to further male character development - in this case, to showcase how evil a character really is. From the article, many of the women who were assaulted were minor characters, with a rape occasionally being their only participation in the entire series.</p>

          <div class="picture">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/got.PNG"></img>
            <p class="description">Network of sexual violence in ASOIAF book series from tumblr user tafkar's data set.</p>
          </div>

          <p>The image above is from a quick network analysis I wrote in R, which consists of the data provided in the analysis linked above. The primitive, undirected graph simply indicates that there are clusters of assaults all committed by a single, named male character.</p>

          <p>In order to bring more attention to this, I am creating a more complete data set archiving not just sexual assault in &quot;Game of Thrones,&quot; but all sex scenes in the series in order to make comparisons between on-screen sex, significant male characters, and discarded female characters. Right now I am putting together a .csv data set using episode descriptions from the <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki">Game of Throne Wikia</a>.</p>
          <p>Once that is complete, I plan to visualize the data a) using network analysis to show which male characters commit the most assaults and whether they are represented as an antagonist in the series; b) interactivity in the network analysis to highlight unnamed female characters; and c) through bar charts to compare statistics on consensual and non-consensual sex scenes. I look forward to fleshing out my ideas for visualizations in d3.js, especially including the new metadata I am adding from the data set I am building.</p>
