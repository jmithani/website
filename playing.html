            <p></p>
            <p><b>Note: this project discusses mass shooters, particularly the case of the EAME Church killings in 2015.</b></p>

            <p>I have been drawn to the analysis of museums, as both an institution of knowledge and pedagogy, since working as an interpretive volunteer at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles. We were tasked with presenting objects to patrons, and instigating dialogues to facilitate meaningful discovery of the context of the object. One of the most striking aspects to me of the course has been the use of artist intervention to decolonialize museums. With little formal training in art history or museology, this concept was completely new to me. Reflecting on my time volunteering, I can easily draw parallels between the type of experience we were trying to give patrons, and how anthropological collections today struggle to give this same thing.</p>

            <p>One reason I volunteered to work at the museum is because I love teaching, and fostering a warm environment for curiosity and experimentation. As an interpretive volunteer, we encouraged patrons to ask questions by engaging with an unfamiliar object - our hope was that by providing an interactive experience, people would remember what they learned by engaging with us. It is with this in mind that I present my final project, an interactive display meant to illustrate the challenges of an artist tasked with intervening in an anthropological archive.</p>

            <p>The inspiration for this project came when I tried to explain the idea of artist intervention to my friends and parents. While the idea was very simple, it was difficult to convince them how it could be implemented, or what difference it could make in a collection. By putting them in the shoes of an artist curating an intervention, I hope to have them understand the motivations behind an intervention more clearly - as well as some of the challenges presented.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The archive, in this case, is a set of materials from a community I have been researching. The True Crime Community (#tcc) on Tumblr is a collection of blogs run by true crime enthusiasts, linked by specific hashtags (#tcc, #truecrimefamily, etc). One of the most striking aspects about this Tumblr community is the participation in normal fandom behaviors (e.g. writing fan fiction, original artwork, etc) despite the grisly subject matter. The most common form of artwork are collages of specific people, usually with aggressively feminine undertones, including pink backgrounds, hearts, and stickers.</p>

            <div class="horizontal">
              <img src="img/manifesth0e.jpg"></img>
              <p>Art by Tumblr user manifesth0e.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Within this community, there is a group who call themselves &quot;roofers,&quot; who focus their fandom on Dylann Roof, who shot and killed nine black people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in June 2015. This group has caused strife in the #tcc because of the racially-motivated nature of Roof&#39;s murders, in contrast to the Columbine or Virginia Tech shooters, who cited bullying as a reason for their violence. The most common motif among roofers is to put a flower crown over an image of Dylann Roof, particularly photos released as a part of his manifesto, rendering an austere, fearful portrait into something quaint and unthreatening. These images are humorous, and without recognizing Roof a viewer could think he was a more positive celebrity. It is only upon closer inspection that the guns are recognized as real, and the flag he is seen burning is that of the United States.</p>

            <p>The reason I chose these images as my archive are because of their deceptive nature. Only after knowing about the person represented does the viewer feel uneasy - much like a museum patron viewing an object that was the product of illegal poaching or slavery. In the overarching analogy of my project, these images are the museum display, and you are the artist tasked with arranging them to fulfill one of three curatorial tasks. To help, I provided a group of historical and academic materials to supplement the course of the intervention, including information about the EAME Church, academic articles about shootings, and interviews with experts about motivations behind mass killings.</p>

            <div class="horizontal">
              <img src="img/mining.jpg"></img>
              <p>&quot;Mining the Museum&quot; by Fred Wilson.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This simulation is not perfect, as it only mimics one form of intervention, akin to Fred Wilson&#39;s &quot;Mining the Museum&quot; at the Maryland Historical Society or Joseph Kosuth&#39;s &quot;The Play of the Unmentionable&quot; at the Brooklyn Museum. However, I hope that it will provide an elementary understanding of the challenges facing an artist when they must intervene in an institution&#39;s selective collection.</p>

            <div class="title">> results</div>

            <p>I put together a kit containing several notebooks to serve as a curatorial space, an archive of images and texts, as well as pens and scissors to write down quotes or cut out pictures. The kit contained the following instructions:</p>

            <p><i>You are an artist with access to an archive, in which you will provide an intervention with one of the curatorial themes (listed below) in mind. In this packet are several sheets of materials, creating an archive for you, as the artist, to draw upon. The original materials you are to meant to create an intervention for are cut out and grouped together in an envelope. You are tasked with arranging the archive to provoke thoughtful responses from viewers. There are scissors for you to cut out images or quotes from the pages provided. Use the glue stick to physically assemble your exhibition in one of the provided Moleskine books. Make sure to give your exhibition a title â€“ curatorial statements are highly encouraged.</i></p>
            
            <p><i>Below are some suggestions for curatorial themes. Feel free to add your own!</i></p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><i>Digital youth culture today</i></li>
              <li><i>The public&#39;s reactions to mass shootings</i></li>
              <li><i>Focus on the victims</i></li>
              <li><i>White supremacy imagery</i></li>
              <li><i>Motivations of mass shooters</i></li>
              <l><i>Modern day fandom communities</i></li>
            </ul>

            <p>I turned in the project for my final, but am hoping to collect it soon so I can post pictures.</p>
