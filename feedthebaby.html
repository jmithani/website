          <p>Feed the Baby was a very quick project put together to show an alternate use of digital games at DoSomething.org. My manager and I had been spending most of our time on <a href="wordsmatter.html">Words Matter</a>, our idea for a standalone product, and wanted to prove that games could fit into other organizational space.</p>
          
          <p>We chose to revamp the &quot;11 Facts About Teenage Pregnancy&quot; webpage, which remained mostly static throughout the year with a call to action to a low-conversion campaign. We wanted to add interactivity to the page in order to test the change in engagement and following the CTA.<p>

          <div class="title">$methodology && solution</div>

          <p>Influenced by <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com">Explorable Explanations</a>, we originally wanted to make an interactive post to show DoSomething members the impact that teenage pregnancy had on education, and poverty. By reframing these facts, we could encourage members to participate in a campaign to make a difference offline.</p>
          <p>However, our team had been moving slowly with this product. I was working the development side, was learning new technologies (HTML Canvas) on my own, and was only working part-time in addition to being in school full-time. After several weeks of little progress, we decided to make a quick game using a familiar framework, so we could focus on collecting and analyzing metrics.</p>
          <p>The first prototype of the game was built by my manager in one night after a stroke of insight. He shared the project with me, and then we <b>coordinated next steps needed in order to make it ready for public release</b>. We <b>strategized to increase replayability, design for virality, and how best to push users to sign up for a campaign</b>.</p>

          <div class="picture"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/bleh.png"></img></div>

          <p>I coded a game feature that made the title baby throw up if fed too much, increasing the difficulty of the game by adding another lose condition. I also randomized the win condition, to give players a different experience every time they played. I helped design A/B tests to be executed on the desktop with Optimize.ly, experimenting with placement on the page and different start screens.</p>

          <div class="title">$results</div>

          <p><p>Using Google Analytics, <b>we tracked the number of pageviews, number of plays, number of replays, number of conversions, and number of Twitter shares</b>. We completed three rounds of A/B testing with Optimize.ly experimenting with different placements and content arrangements on the page. <b>My suggestion to make the game visible when the user first views the page (as opposed to having to scroll down) resulted in the highest engagement and conversion numbers<b>.</p>

          <div class="picture"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/11facts.png"></img></div>
          <p class="description">One of the placements we tested. We received the most interactions when the game was placed above the fold.</p>

          <p>Adding the interactive game to the page resulted in a <b>542% increase in users responding to the CTA</b>. The campaign that we designed the game for occurs once a year, and is now finished. Now that we have built our game, and it has been proven as an effective conversion tool, it can be easily reactivated on the DoSomething website during the annual campaign run. Most importantly, this project proved that gaming and interactivity were valuable tools to a social activism organization, and provided key deliverables to support a new, experimental venture.</p>
