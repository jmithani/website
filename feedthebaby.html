          <h1>Feed the Baby</h1>
          <h2>December 2015 - March 2016</h2>

          <div class="title">> background</div>

          <p>Feed the Baby was a very quick project (approximately one month development time) put together to show an alternate use of digital games at DoSomething.org. My manager and I had been spending most of our time on <a href="wordsmatter.html">Words Matter</a>, our idea for a standalone product, and wanted to prove that games could fit into other spaces in our organization. Our first thought was to revamp the &quot;11 Facts About Teenage Pregnancy&quot; webpage, which remained mostly static throughout the year with a link to a low-conversion campaign. Influenced by <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com">Explorable Explanations</a>, we originally wanted to make an interactive post so DoSomething members could understand the impact that teenage pregnancy had on education, and poverty. By reframing these facts, we could encourage members to participate in a campaign to make a difference offline.</p>

          <div class="horizontal"><img src="img/bleh.png"></img></div>
          <div class="title">> process</div>

          <p>With regard to explorable explanations, our team had been moving slowly. I was learning new technologies (advanced HTML, CSS, Canvas), and was only working part-time in addition to being in school full-time. We decided to make a quick game using a familiar framework, in order to have something produced by the end of the year. The first version of the game was completed in December 2015. I went on to add a game feature that made the title baby throw up if fed too much, increasing the difficulty of the game. I also randomized the win condition, to increase replayability. I helped design A/B tests to be executed on the desktop with Optimize.ly, experimenting with placement on the page and different start screens.</p>

          <div class="double-pic-spacer">One of the placements we tested. We received the most interactions when the game was placed above the fold of the webpage.</div>
          <div class="horizontal"><img src="img/11facts.png"></img></div>
          <div class="title">> results</div>

          <p>We completed three rounds of A/B testing with Optimize.ly, and my suggestions for deployment resulted in a 542% increase in users clicking through to a campaign. The campaign that we designed the game for occurs once a year, and is now finished. Now that we have built our game, and it has been proven as an effective conversion tool, it can be easily reactivated on the DoSomething website during the annual campaign run. Most importantly, this project proved that gaming and interactivity were valuable tools to a social activism organization, and provided key deliverables to support a new, experimental venture.</p>
