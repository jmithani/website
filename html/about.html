    About Me
  </div>

  <div id="content">

    <p>I&#39;m a designer, developer, and researcher slated to graduate from The University of Chicago in June 2017. I combine my loves of art and technology to make a better world. I harness my dual skill sets of development and design to create user experiences, and digital products. Above all, my design philosophy revolves around empathy &#45; for the user, for the people I work with, and for society. I practice these ends through engaging projects in data visualization, product design, user experience, digital humanities, and new media. I am particularly interested in applications to museology, civic tech, and education.</p>

    <p>My research informs my practice, and it focuses on interactive media, critical design, and femininity on the internet. I&#39;m an expert on designing games for social activism, and digital feminine knowledge networks &#45; or, how women use the internet to share content. I&#39;m also an advocate for marginalized populations, and strive to lift up women, people of color, disabled persons and queer perspectives in all my activities.</p>

    <p>At The University of Chicago, I run three student organizations (two focusing on women in tech!) in addition to working part time to support myself. I&#39;ve authored by own degree program in Design, Media, and Technology, featuring coursework in anthropology, art, computer science, and media studies.</p>

    <p>I&#39;m always on the lookout for opportunities that blend art, technology, and social good. I&#39;m planning on graduating in June 2017, and am actively seeking internship and full-time opportunities.</p>

    <p>I&#39;d love to chat about any projects or ideas, and I enjoy meeting new people. My email is jazzmithani [at] gmail.com, and you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jazzmyth">@jazzmyth</a>. My full work history is on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jmithani">LinkedIn</a>, and you can checkout what I&#39;m working on at my <a href="https://github.com/jmithani">Github</a> page.</p>
