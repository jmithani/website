    <p><i>Hi! This page is still a work in progress. I have included some notes about the project, and links where appropriate. If you want to know why I have been so busy lately, check out my <a href=”http://twitter.com/jazzmyth>Twitter</a> and my <a href=”http://linkedin.com/in/jmithani”>LinkedIn</a>!</i>

    <p>Feed the Baby was a very quick project (approximately one month development time) put together to show an alternate use of digital games at DoSomething.org. My manager and I had been spending most of our time on <a href="wordsmatter.html">Words Matter</a>, our idea for a standalone product, and wanted to prove that games could fit into other spaces in our organization. Our first thought was to revamp the &quot;11 Facts About Teenage Pregnancy&quot; webpage, which remained mostly static throughout the year with a link to a low-conversion campaign. We originally wanted to try something along the lines of an <a href="http://explorableexplanations.com">Explorable Explanation</a>, so that DoSomething members could understand the impact that teenage pregnancy had on education, and poverty. By reframing these facts, we could encourage members to participate in a campaign to make a difference offline.

    <p>As the end of 2015 approached, we decided to focus on development tools we already knew (Phaser, as opposed to HTML Canvas) to create a game that added interactivity and pushed to a campaign page. We also added a way for players to share their scores via Twitter. So far we have completed three rounds of A/B testing with Optimize.ly, and have most recently seen a 542% increase in users clicking through to a campaign.</p>
